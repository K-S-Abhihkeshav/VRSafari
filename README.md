# Virtual Safari VR 

## Overview  
Virtual Safari VR is an immersive VR experience that allows users to explore a virtual wildlife environment. Users can navigate through a 3D-rendered safari, interact with various animals, and learn about them through gaze-based interactions. The experience is designed for Google Cardboard and other VR-compatible headsets.

## Features  
1. **Virtual Safari Environment**  
   - A fully 3D-rendered safari with trees, pathways, and realistic animal habitats.  
   - Various roaming animals such as tigers, wolves, deer, horses, and chickens.  
   - Environmental elements like trees, flowers, and stone for realism.  

2. **VR-Based Interaction**  
   - **Locomotion**: Users can move forward continuously or teleport using VR controllers.  
   - **Gaze-Based Interaction**: Looking at animals triggers an information popup about the species.   

3. **Unity & Google Cardboard Integration**  
   - Built using `Unity 3D` with VR support.  
   - Compatible with Google Cardboard and other VR headsets.  
   - Developed using `C#` scripting for movement, interactions, and UI elements.
